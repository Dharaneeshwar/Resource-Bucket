### Why am I doing this?

The most asked questions to me are about finding **THE BEST** resource to learn something in Programming or Development.  

So, I decided to create this repository. 

## Things to know 

- I am not a fan of **top-5** or **top-10** resources.
    - It doesn't have a proper reason for why one resource is better than another or why there is a 5th resource when 4 other resources are listed above it.
- Still, I have decided to provide multiple resources under a topic. I have categorised them into 
    - **Paid/Free** resource 
    - If you want to learn it **seriously** or just **dabble around**.   
- The courses or resources referred here are *used by me* to learn and/or recommended by me to my friends and got a whole lot of *positive responses*.  

**Note:** ***I'm not associated with any of the third-party resources mentioned.*** 

These are made to help people who are looking for resources to learn. I know finding a good resource from zillions of resources is tough. That's why we are here.  

# Learn Today 

The best time to start learning was yesterday. The second best time to start learning is **Today**.

## Coding 

This might be the most boring part in the long run, but this is the most essential part to get your programming journey started.

### Python 
**To read:** [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) is a platform I use even today and it's a great place to learn or to clarify your doubts even if you know the language. 

**Video Tutorials:** [Python Tutorials for beginners - Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXeEoD0pB3E&list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3&ab_channel=Telusko)

### Javascript 

Here is a go-to tutorial for Js online for free. 
Watch it on [Youtube by Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2md4HQNRqJA&list=PLRAV69dS1uWSxUIk5o3vQY2-_VKsOpXLD&ab_channel=HiteshChoudhary)

This is not just coding stuff. This is a great starting point for development as well. If you are totally new to development or even coding, ***This is the place to start*** 

*Note: If you already know a language other than javascript, the best way to learn Js is by totally forgetting them and learn JS as if you don't know anything.*

## Development 

Building projects is the most fun thing in programming and thus I loved it. 

### Frontend Design 

I'm including this first because **HTML and CSS** are the core basics of web dev. Although I was a backend first (Django) web developer, I slowly made my way into the front-end development. 

I would recommend you to parallelly spend **30-40%** of your time in *front-end design* if you start with a back-end based frameworks like Django. 

I am recommending a crash course from [Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&t=551s&ab_channel=DesignCourse) which is a youtube tutorial that teaches you how to build a website from scratch.

### Bootstrap

*Bootstrap is awesome.* 

Some people say bootstrap is not good. I get them. Building from scratch will give you complete control over minute adjustments that you will appreciate.

I feel that if a library or a framework is making our job easier and it saves our time. Their is no harm in using that.

Interestingly, the best to learn and practice bootstrap is through the [official documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)  

### Django 
If you like python and want to build websites, this is the way to go.

What I used: [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIyxjRJ8VNY&list=PLsyeobzWxl7r2ukVgTqIQcl-1T0C2mzau&ab_channel=Telusko)  

Updated 2021 Version: [ProgrammingwithMosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHux0gMZ3Eg&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh) 

Paid(Rs.299): [FullStack Django Developer Freelance ready](https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/FullStack-Django-Developer-Freelance-ready) 
(If you want to learn it the best way)

### React

The Crash Course: [Building a todo app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvHeB32ICDM&t=3s&ab_channel=HiteshChoudhary)

Free Youtube Course: [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

### Angular + SpringBoot 

Angular and SpringBoot has become the *popular choice* for the companies that work in Java. 

[Java Guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLBX9fq813c&list=PLGRDMO4rOGcNzi3CpBWsCdQSzbjdWWy-f&ab_channel=JavaGuides) was a beautiful crisp course to learn and build a massive project using Angular and SpringBoot within a week. This worked for us. 

### MERN 
If you want to do FullStack Web Development with one language, **MERN is the way to go**. Everything is Js here.  

Personally I have not worked on MERN stack. But I have recommended this course for a good number of people and *positive response is all I got*. 

**Learn Code Online (Rs.199) -** [Full Stack MERN Bootcamp](https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/Full-Stack-MERN-Bootcamp) 
(The prices mentioned are based on the time of creating this list.)

*More to come...*
